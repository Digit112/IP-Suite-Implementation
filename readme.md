# My IP Suite Implementation
## This implementation sucks!
It does not come close to strictly enforcing the protocols it implements, and often leaves out features they provide, (For example, DiffServ in IPv4 and the Security/Precedence functionality of TCP). Furthermore, the code is haphazard, relatively patched-together and not 100% consistent in its design philosophy.

So you may be wondering, What's this guy's deal? Well, this is an academic exercise, I only wish to learn how these protocols work, and have no desire to see these implementations used in the wild. If my implementations can interact, on at least a minimal level, with real-world implementations successfully (grab a webpage, perform a successful SSH authentication) then I'll have succeeded in my goal. Maybe some time in the future I'll make a nice, well-documented, polished implementation. Probably not though.

I saw no reason this repository should be private, so it's not.
